### How to use

The first option is to use the Executable. On Windows you just have to type in the command prompt the *.\version.exe*. Unfortuantely there are no executables for Linux and MacOS. The alterantiv Way is to compile the code. I recomend for this the gcc Compiler. Here is a little step how to create the executable.

1. Download gcc from the GNU [Webside](https://gcc.gnu.org).
2. Make the commands from gcc in the source Folder accesable. We do not explane how it works because it under every operating system different.
3. Run in the source Folder ```gcc Locic.c```. This should create you the executable.

Under Linux there are some other ways to install it:

Ubuntu, Debian ..
```sh
sudo apt install gcc
```

Arch
```sh
sudo pacman -S gcc
```

After you have an executable, you can run the program. A guid how to use the programm can be found in the version folder.
